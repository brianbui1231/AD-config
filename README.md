  <p> This is a simple manual or lab environment of how to integrate the usage of Virtual Machine in a supported operating system such as Windows. In this lab, we will be using multiple Windows 10 VMs with Windows 10 server 2022 to depict the utilization of user authentication and authorization within an active directory (AD). The essential goal of this lab is to give knowledge of AD works in environments such as Windows using their personally built tools and other third-party software that you might use.
